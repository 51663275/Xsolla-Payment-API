Virtual Currency Protocol allows to exchange the real currency into virtual currency with the pre-set exchange rate. Virtual Currency Protocol is an easy and accesible solution for those projects which have in-game virtual currency with the predetermined value. Users get the pre-set amount of virtual currency when replenish their accounts in game. Players can make payments from e-wallets, cash kiosks, mobile, online-banking, etc.

Cash protocol enables game projects to sell packs of virtual goods and services. When using the protocol of this type, an order is made on the side of the game project.
